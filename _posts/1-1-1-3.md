## Let's talk gender and racial diversity

* When it comes to diversity, gender and race appear to be in two separate silos
* Very rarely have I heard talk of women of colour at diversity in tech events
* Some of you may think we are all women and race has nothing to do with it because _"I don't see colour"_
* Women of colour may think, _"why am I not being represented at these groups that aim for the inclusion of all?"_

On Saturday February 6th 2016 we all got a little #BlackGirlMagic sprinkled on us and it sparked conversation in many communities.
* Is it about Black Lives Matters?
* Is it about Girl Power?

It's both! It's about Black Girl Power and a forgotten subset of our society.
