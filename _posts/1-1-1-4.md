## Let's Break it Down

* According to the **2011 Census**, people from a BAME (Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic) background formed 40.2% of the Greater London population. That's quite a big chunk of us! Yet we ***do not*** occupy 40% of technology roles in London
* A late 2015 [Creative Skillset Employment Survey](#) showed that 19% of roles in the games industry are occupied by Women. Which is higher than the national average.
* The same survey showed that only 4% of roles in the games industry are represented by BAME people (the national average is 10%).
